# What The F*%k!
> So first of all, what. the. actual. f*%k. This has been one hell of a year, it's not even over and I'm just trying to reflect already in hopes that it will be over soon. Last time I wrote anything in this blog was 2 years ago and I just had to write a post in 2020. What a crazy year.

# COVID-19 Pandemic
> I've always been a fan of horror movies, classics like [28 Days Later][1] and shows like [The Walking Dead][2] are, without a doubt, my favorite. I even sometimes fantasized about living in a post-apocalyptic world, I thought life would be a lot more simple. I guess I still think that, but anyways COVID-19-era world is NOT what I would consider simple. It basically took all the negatives of a post-apocalyptic world and none of the positives like free food and not worrying about your future, because, of course, you will probably die the next day, so who cares!

# Toilet Paper Famine
> Yes, there was a famine, a toilet paper famine. People literally thought "Hey there is a new pandemic in town! We better hoard all the toilet paper then...".

# Lock-down and Social Distancing
> Everything was shutdown for months! And I mean everything! It's almost ridiculous how we can adapt as humans no matter what happens. We are talking about every. single. thing. was closed. Many businesses closed permanantly. People were socially distancing themselves from their loved ones. Friends stopped seeing each other for months. I mean hey, I'm an introvert but even I was getting lonely. I feel bad for you my fellow extroverts. Oh and don't get me started on the damn masks, I mean the masks themselves are fine, I'm talking about the people who either wear them and leave their noses uncovered (the under-nosers), hang them around their necks (the neckers), or actually wear them but put a hole where the mouth is (the dimwits). I never thought deeply about how 50% of the population is below average intelligence, but that statement rung very true during the pandemic. It's all so surreal.

# Recession
> Of course with a lock-down comes economic problems of the recession type. I actually took this time and started investing some extra money through [Robinhood][3]. I gained almost $10000 then proceeded to lose it all on some stupid trades. Lesson learned, no more gambling. But yeah, the economy is still in shambles, everyone is trying to ignore that fact or pretend it's not true but the next few years will show the true effects of this economical downturn.

# The Future
> I don't know what the future holds, but it can't get any worse. We will all continue living, adapting, and overcoming. Life is just that simple.

# In conclusion
> I'm writing this while being half asleep because I stayed up all night working. Hope whoever you are, dear reader, that you are in excellent health at the time of reading this post. Enjoy the rest of your day and thanks for stopping by!
