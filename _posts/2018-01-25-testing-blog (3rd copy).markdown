title: Testing Blog
layout: post
---

This is just dummy content to test the blog capabilities of the site. For instance, we can add `code` tags like so. We can also add `code` blocks like the following:

```
{% highlight java %}
	class Dummy{
		public Dummy{
			//dummy constructor
		}
	}
{% endhighlight %}
```

Very powerfull features indeed, gotta love Jekyll.
