# Post Pandemic
> Looking back at my [Twenty Twenty][1] blog post, it's crazy how life has changed for me and how I, as a person, have changed. During the past 4 years so many things have happened that I would have to write a 20 page essay to capture it all, but I wanted to at least give a few highlights on how it has been going for me and hopefully look into what the future can possibly hold!

# Work
> I was one of the lucky few in the tech industry to not be affected by layoffs, in fact, I have gotten promotions through-out the past 4 years. I decided to take a shot at managing engineers and it has been my calling ever since. In the past 4 years i've managed 4 different teams, faced many challenges, and accomplished a lot. I'm thankful for my experience at my current job and the level of growth I have exprienced in the past 6.5 years of my career!

# Life
> And what do you know, the person who wrote that [Twenty Twenty][1] blog post is definitely not the same person writing this post. I've changed a lot, not just personality-wise, but also through life circumstances as well. At the time I was single and not even in the dating scene, COVID didn't make that part easier either, but now I'm a married man and about to celebrate our first anniversary. Lot's of things can change in 4 years, you never realize it until you sit down and write about it.

# The Present
> In my [Twenty Twenty][1] post, I wrote about how I didn't know what the future holds, well that remains true today. The only difference is now I have the super power of reflection and I can confidently say, dear Ali, that things did not get worse! Well done buddy, amazing predictions.


# The Future
> Since my record of predicting the future is 1/1, or commonly known as 100% success rate, I have a pretty good feeling that what I'm about to predict is going to come true! First of all, you will buy a house, you will probably move someplace nice, you will switch jobs and you will be content!

# In conclusion
> Four years between updates is insane, and I cannot promise a more frequent update schedule, but it's been fun reflecting on the past. See you next time!
